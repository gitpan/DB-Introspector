Version .08
* Fixed bug# 7499, which caused a DB::Introspector::MySQL::Introspector
  incompatibility with MySQL index introspection for MySQL version before 4.0.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7499
* DB::Introspector::Base::SpecialColumn was added to capture all column types
  that are not mapped by the introspector driver. Previously, the behavior was
  to die when an unknown column was found. 
* Added Function based index support for DB::Introspector::Oracle::Introspector

Version .07
* DB::Introspector::Util::RelInspect produced backwards paths (each element in
  the path seemed to be reversed), this is now fixed
* DB::Introspector::Oracle::Introspector is now compatible with Oracle 8i. It
  was previously only compatible with Oracle 9i.

Version .05
* First implementation of DB::Introspector::SerializeUtil, which is used to
  cache DB::Introspector instances for those cases (when using Oracle) when
  metadata traversal is slow.

Version .04
* Implemented support for Indexes
* Fixed find_table bug (exploited when find_all_tables was called before find_table)
* Added more helpful comments in POD
* Added Test::Unit::TestRunner as a dependency of this project

Version .03
* Implemented MySQL support (Alpha)
* Handling type attributes (length, not null, etc)
* Refactored a bit out of CommonRDB and placed into Introspector.pm
